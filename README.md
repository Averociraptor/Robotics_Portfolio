# Avery's Robotics Portfolio

This is going to be a robot with a 2-speed manual transmission powered by 2 motors behind a friction plate clutch in order to prevent the transmission from ripping itself. This will also have front steering like a real car.

9/7/2023 1:00 ish, I'm going to test whether or not we actually need a clutch for the system, if we don't that will cut an extra motor and a lot of work.
9/7/2023 1:40, We discovered a clutch is not actually needed, it shifts perfectly without the clutch even being present on the module.
