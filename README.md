# Avery's Robotics Portfolio

This is going to be a robot with a 2-speed manual transmission powered by 2 motors behind a friction plate clutch in order to prevent the transmission from ripping itself. This will also have front steering like a real car.

9/7/2023 1:00 PM ish, I'm going to test whether or not we actually need a clutch for the system, if we don't that will cut an extra motor and a lot of work.

9/7/2023 1:40 PM, We discovered a clutch is not actually needed, it shifts perfectly without the clutch even being present on the module.

9/8/2023 9:30 AM, I need to work on the gearing system to mount the 2 motors for propelling the machine. Once I get that done I can work on either improving the drive shaft by cutting it down and hoping that solves the problem of it being unstable, or entirely replacing that axle with a new stable one. my current plan after that consists of just having a 1:1 gear ratio coming off the output axle to power the rear wheels. I see one main problem with the rear axle the way I plan to have it, but it could be fixed by using 2 axles and 2 outputs off the transmission. The problem I see at the moment is the lack of any plan to have a rear differential to allow for better steering. The frame of the car is already very wide so I'm going to have to come up with a way to mount the wheels and axles, or instead of having them on the outside of the robot, we instead have them on the inside. this is just something I'm going to have to figure out how to do on Tuesday next week, 9/12/2023

9/12/2023 *doing this a bit later* 6:13 PM, Unfortunately, it took me way longer than I had hoped to mount both motors to the transmission, so on 9/14/2023 ill have to mount the transmission somehow and build a differential or attach 2 different axles somehow.

9/14/2023 *doing this earlier today* 7:47 AM, Today my current goal is to at least mount the brain, battery, and transmission. After that, I want to wire everything and work with a teammate to program the second motor. If I still have time after that I'm going to spend the rest of the class thinking and maybe building prototype parts for the output system from the transmission. When I have a design set out I can begin building or prototyping that system. Once  feel confident with the design I can work on putting it on the robot.

9/19/2023 7:34 AM, I've quickly and honestly shoddily built an output from the transmission to one wheel as a demonstration of the idea that it works. Also what I need to do today is to finish the rear axle, where I've decided I don't want to try to build/design a differential so it's going to be a solid axle. On top of that Matt *the programmer* needs to reverse the motor's programmed direction so that pushing the stick forward drives the wheel forward. I also need to add a tensioner to the chain that is actively driving the axle. This is all going to be determined based on the time Matt takes to program, and how long it takes me to build the tensioner and to stabilize both the transmission and drive axles.
